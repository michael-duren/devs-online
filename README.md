# TUI CHAT

## Using `websockets` to create a TUI chat app

This repo is for a meetup presentation.

### Meetup Description

Go lang methodology is notorious for simplicity and building
your own tools. In this meetup, we will dive into how `websockets`
actually work by briefly reviewing the `rfc6455` standard,
implementing a simple `websocket` with go's `net/http`
package and then building a TUI chat app with `charmbracelet/bubbletea`.

After this meetup, you will have a better understanding of how `websockets`
work, how to implement them in go, and create simple applications all
without touching a front-end framework or the web browser.
